# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sarath!

Welcome to my GitHub page!  
I'm a **software engineer** who loves to **build, explore, and learn** new things every single day. Whether it’s backend systems with **Spring Boot**, crafting UIs with **React** or **Next.js**, or experimenting with **Flutter** for mobile apps — I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code.

### 💡 What I Do
- 🧠 **Languages & Frameworks:** Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Spring Boot, React, Next.js, Flutter  
- 🗄️ **Databases:** SQL  
- 🐧 **Environment & Tools:** Linux, Docker  

I’m always open to exciting **freelance opportunities**, collaborations, and innovative projects that push boundaries.

### ⚽ Fun Fact
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on the **football field** — I’m as passionate about football as I am about software engineering. Teamwork, strategy, and persistence drive me both in code and in the game.
